- STARTING PATH: "replication/code/model"
  - (e.g., the path of "m0_model_run_all.py" should be "replication/code/model/m0_model_run_all.py")
  - (e.g., the path of "create_tables.py" should be "replication/code/model/depends/create_tables")

- Therefore, you should make a new folder (its name = "replication") after downloading this page (including all files and folders).
- Then, make a sub-folder (its name = "code") and its sub-folder (its name = "model").
- In doing so, whole files and the folder of this page should be put into the "replication/code/model" folder.
